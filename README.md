# Impossible Simplicity

## About
This interactive video performance system is part of "Duets in Latent Space", exploring the intersection of human movement, machine learning, and real-time video manipulation. The system creates a dynamic, responsive environment where video content morphs and flows in response to the performer's movements.

## Concept
The work investigates the relationship between human gesture and digital response, creating a duet between the performer and the machine learning system. Through body tracking and real-time video manipulation, the piece explores themes of presence, embodiment, and the latent space between human and machine interaction.
